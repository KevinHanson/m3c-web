Note: there is a design requirement that the code under `src/` should be easy
for non-programmers to understand (simple) and support a wide-range of browsers
(namely, Internet Explorer 9) without any build tools. Dissimilarly, the code
under `tests/` is using Node and Mocha, so feel free to use all the arrow
functions and object destructuring you want.
